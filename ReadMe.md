# ImJoy plugin development

Here we describe the different steps when developing a Python plugin for ImJoy.

* Development of the Python code
* Packing the code as pip module
* Developing the plugin
* Writing a documentation with MkDocs
* Deploying and distributing the code on GitHub.

**Disclaimer**: this is only a proposed workflow, intended to facilitate getting started.
Many other options exist.

For a detailed description we refer to the [documentation](https://muellerflorian.github.io/ImJoy-demo-project/).
